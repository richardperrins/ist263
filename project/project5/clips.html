            <p>I enjoyed working on this story because it allowed me to become invested and knowledgeable about the Syracuse community outside of the university’s bubble. Lead paint issues had been known in the city for decades, and The Daily Orange had extensively reported on it in the past. I thought it would be interesting to focus on data — to what extent is lead exposure still relevant in the city? I think the strongest part of this story was my conversation with a member of the community whose children had been affected by lead poisoning in their home, and the conversation still sticks with me.

            <p>One of the major issues in the Syracuse community in the last decade has been the ongoing effort to replace the Interstate 81 viaduct. The viaduct historically disrupted and destroyed predominantly Black neighborhoods in the greater Syracuse area, which in combination with redlining serves as the root of persistent issues with racial equity in the city. I looked into one of the plans to replace the viaduct, Blueprint 15, and how it planned to improve the situation.</p>

            <p>I came across this story because of personal relationships I had with members of the Remembrance Program at the time. This story was particularly impactful because of the long-standing and respected nature of the Remembrance Program on Syracuse University’s campus — the revelation that certain victims of Pan Am Flight 103, who had been honored by the program for decades, had such material in their archives that had gone undiscovered for so long caused a stir on campus. I dug through the university archives to find the material, which led to extensive coverage of the situation across campus.</p>

            <a href="https://www.dailyorange.com/2021/09/students-protest-ifc-fraternities-sexual-assault-allegations/">Story 4</a>
            <p>As the largest coverage I have been a part of in my time at The Daily Orange, I thought I should include my work to cover the extensive fraternity protests that took place on SU’s campus in the fall of 2021. I worked with several coworkers to cover the marches and protests that took place over the course of several weeks. It was difficult because of the sensitive content — these students were protesting allegations of sexual assault, so I had to protect their own misgivings on sharing their own stories while making sure I follow all steps to verify the charges posited against the fraternities in question. But it was the largest protest I’ve seen on campus (#NotAgainSU was far larger, but I was not yet on campus), so I’m glad we covered it to the extent that we did.</p>

            <p>I enjoy stories that take a deep dive into court documents, because they represent an underreported and hard to follow area of this university. I believe one of the primary goals of a student publication should be to hold the university accountable and be a watchdog, which is what I think I accomplished with this story. It involved a lot of close reading of pages and pages of court text and testimony, which I found by paying close attention to the local court docket. </p>
