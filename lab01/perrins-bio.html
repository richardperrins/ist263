    </head>
    <body>
        My name is Richard Perrins. Iâ€™m a junior at Syracuse University. I have a dual major in political science in magazine, news & digital journalism, with a specific interest in newspaper reporting and editing. My main affiliation on campus is with The Daily Orange, for which I have served a variety of roles including copy editor, news editor and editor-in-chief. Outside of school and work, my main interest is soccer. I am a huge Manchester United fan and have been watching and playing soccer since I was extremely young. I grew up just north of London, England, but now live in Cleveland, Ohio.
